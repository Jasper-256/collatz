# Collatz

A basic [collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) (3x+1 problem) solver for python that can solve arbitrarily large numbers!

## How to use

Run all files with Python 3 or newer

Use input.py for an easy way to test many different specific numbers quickly

Use batch.py to constantly run through a bunch of different large numbers

Use manual.py to manually test different numbers (usefull if the number you want to test is so huge that you can't type it in through python input)
